Net::DNS README
============

  This is a port of the Perl Net::DNS module, written by Michael Fuhr
and now currently maintained by Olaf Kolkman (www.net-dns.org). It
keeps the same interfaces and function names, although has a bit
improved OO and some other stuff.
It can be used to query DNS servers for various kind of records, perform
zone transfer and dynamic updates. It has even a class for acting as a
nameserver.
This version is quite incomplete. You can use it as a resolver.


Requirements
------------

  * Ruby 1.6


Install
-------

  De-compress archive and enter its top directory.
  Then type:

  location of Ruby libraries.  You can also install files into
  your favorite directory by supplying setup.rb some options.
  Try "ruby setup.rb --help".

  In doc/ you will find many useful documents too.
