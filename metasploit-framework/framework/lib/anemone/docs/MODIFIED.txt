This snapshot of Anemone has been modified for use within the Metasploit Framework

 * Extract links from additional elements in page.links()
 * Insert a callback to use a custom Net::HTTP factory
 * Insert a callback to tweak HTTP requests before they are sent
 * Addition of core.shutdown() to stop all background threads
 * Addition of a Rex::Proto::HTTP version of anemone/http
 * Handle Rex::Proto::HTTP headers (not arrays)
 * Disable freeze_options() since it can recurse into the framework/module options
 * Addition of a page.request accessor to store the associated raw request
